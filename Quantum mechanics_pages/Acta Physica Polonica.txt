Acta Physica Polonica is an open access peer-reviewed scientific journal covering research in physics. It was established by the Polish Physical Society in 1920. In 1970 is split into two journals Acta Physica Polonica A and Acta Physica Polonica B. The two journals became independent in 1995, with series A published by the Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences and series B published by the Jagiellonian University in cooperation with the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences.


== History ==
Acta Physica Polonica was established by the Polish Physical Society in 1920. In 1970 it was split into Acta Physica Polonica A (published by the Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences), whose scope includes general physics, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, and cross-disciplinary topics, and Acta Physica Polonica B (published by the Jagiellonian University), which covers mathematical physics, particle and nuclear physics, relativity, astrophysics, and statistical physics. The editors-in-chief are Witold D. Dobrowolski and Michal Praszalowicz. In 2008, Acta Physica Polonica B Proceedings Supplement was established.


== Abstracting and Indexing ==
Acta Physica Polonica A has a 2013 impact factor of 0.604, while the B series has an impact factor of 0.998. Acta Physica Polonica B is part of the SCOAP3 initiative.
