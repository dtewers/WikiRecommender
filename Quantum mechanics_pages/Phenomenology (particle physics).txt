Particle physics phenomenology is the part of theoretical particle physics that deals with the application of theoretical physics to high-energy experiments. Phenomenology forms a bridge between the mathematical models of theoretical physics (such as quantum field theories and theories of the structure of space-time) and experimental particle physics, by making quantitative predictions based upon the theoretical models. Phenomenology is related to the philosophical notion in that these predictions describe anticipated behaviors for phenomena in reality.


== Applications ==


=== Standard Model consequences ===
Within the well-tested and generally accepted Standard Model, phenomenology is the calculating of detailed predictions for experiments, usually at high precision (e.g., including radiative corrections).
Examples include:
Next-to-leading order calculations of particle production rates and distributions.
Monte Carlo simulation studies of physics processes at colliders.
Extraction of parton distribution functions from data.


==== CKM matrix calculations ====

The CKM matrix is useful in these predictions:
Application of heavy quark effective field theory to extract CKM matrix elements.
Using lattice QCD to extract quark masses and CKM matrix elements from experiment.


=== Theoretical models ===
In physics Beyond the Standard Model, phenomenology addresses the experimental consequences of new models: how their new particles could be searched for, how the model parameters could be measured, and how the model could be distinguished from other, competing models.


==== Phenomenological analysis ====
Phenomenological analyses, in which one studies the experimental consequences of adding the most general set of beyond-the-Standard-Model effects in a given sector of the Standard Model, usually parameterized in terms of anomalous couplings and higher-dimensional operators. In this case, the term "phenomenological" is being used more in its philosophy of science sense.
