In quantum mechanics, the position operator is the operator that corresponds to the position observable of a particle. The eigenvalue of the operator is the position vector of the particle.


== Introduction ==
In one dimension, the square modulus of the wave function, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        
          
            |
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          ψ
          
            ∗
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi |^{2}=\psi ^{*}\psi }
  , represents the probability density of finding the particle at position 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . Hence the expected value of a measurement of the position of the particle is

  
    
      
        ⟨
        x
        ⟩
        =
        
          ∫
          
            −
            ∞
          
          
            +
            ∞
          
        
        x
        
          |
        
        ψ
        
          
            |
          
          
            2
          
        
        d
        x
        =
        
          ∫
          
            −
            ∞
          
          
            +
            ∞
          
        
        
          ψ
          
            ∗
          
        
        x
        ψ
        d
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle x\rangle =\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }x|\psi |^{2}dx=\int _{-\infty }^{+\infty }\psi ^{*}x\psi dx}
  
Accordingly, the quantum mechanical operator corresponding to position is 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}
  , where

  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}\psi (x)=x\psi (x)}
  
The circumflex over the x on the left side indicates an operator, so that this equation may be read The result of the operator x acting on any function ψ(x) equals x multiplied by ψ(x). Or more simply, the operator x multiplies any function ψ(x) by x.


== Eigenstates ==
The eigenfunctions of the position operator, represented in position space, are Dirac delta functions. To show this, suppose that 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
   is an eigenstate of the position operator with eigenvalue 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
  . We write the eigenvalue equation in position coordinates,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}\psi (x)=x\psi (x)=x_{0}\psi (x)}
  
recalling that 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}}
   simply multiplies the function by 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in the position representation. Since 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a variable while 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
   is a constant, 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
   must be zero everywhere except at 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=x_{0}}
  . The normalized solution to this is

  
    
      
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
        =
        δ
        (
        x
        −
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi (x)=\delta (x-x_{0})}
  
Although such a state is physically unrealizable and, strictly speaking, not a function, it can be thought of as an "ideal state" whose position is known exactly (any measurement of the position always returns the eigenvalue 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{0}}
  ). Hence, by the uncertainty principle, nothing is known about the momentum of such a state.


== Three dimensions ==
The generalisation to three dimensions is straightforward. The wavefunction is now 
  
    
      
        ψ
        (
        
          
            r
          
        
        ,
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ({\mathbf {r}},t)}
   and the expectation value of the position is

  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          
            r
          
        
        ⟩
        =
        ∫
        
          
            r
          
        
        
          |
        
        ψ
        
          
            |
          
          
            2
          
        
        
          d
          
            3
          
        
        
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle {\mathbf {r}}\rangle =\int {\mathbf {r}}|\psi |^{2}d^{3}{\mathbf {r}}}
  
where the integral is taken over all space. The position operator is

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                r
                ^
              
            
          
        
        ψ
        =
        
          
            r
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathbf {\hat {r}}}\psi ={\mathbf {r}}\psi }
  


== Momentum space ==
In momentum space, the position operator in one dimension is

  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ^
            
          
        
        =
        i
        ℏ
        
          
            d
            
              d
              p
            
          
        
        =
        i
        
          
            d
            
              d
              
                k
                
                  x
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\hat {x}}=i\hbar {\frac {d}{dp}}=i{\frac {d}{dk_{x}}}}
  


== Formalism ==
Consider, for example, the case of a spinless particle moving in one spatial dimension (i.e. in a line). The state space for such a particle is L2(R), the Hilbert space of complex-valued and square-integrable (with respect to the Lebesgue measure) functions on the real line. The position operator, Q, is then defined by:

  
    
      
        Q
        (
        ψ
        )
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q(\psi )(x)=x\psi (x)}
  
with domain

  
    
      
        D
        (
        Q
        )
        =
        {
        ψ
        ∈
        
          L
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          
            R
          
        
        )
        
        
          |
        
        
        Q
        ψ
        ∈
        
          L
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          
            R
          
        
        )
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle D(Q)=\{\psi \in L^{2}({\mathbf {R} })\,|\,Q\psi \in L^{2}({\mathbf {R} })\}.}
  
Since all continuous functions with compact support lie in D(Q), Q is densely defined. Q, being simply multiplication by x, is a self adjoint operator, thus satisfying the requirement of a quantum mechanical observable. Immediately from the definition we can deduce that the spectrum consists of the entire real line and that Q has purely continuous spectrum, therefore no discrete eigenvalues. The three-dimensional case is defined analogously. We shall keep the one-dimensional assumption in the following discussion.


== Measurement ==
As with any quantum mechanical observable, in order to discuss measurement, we need to calculate the spectral resolution of Q:

  
    
      
        Q
        =
        ∫
        λ
        d
        
          Ω
          
            Q
          
        
        (
        λ
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q=\int \lambda d\Omega _{Q}(\lambda ).}
  
Since Q is just multiplication by x, its spectral resolution is simple. For a Borel subset B of the real line, let 
  
    
      
        
          χ
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi _{B}}
   denote the indicator function of B. We see that the projection-valued measure ΩQ is given by

  
    
      
        
          Ω
          
            Q
          
        
        (
        B
        )
        ψ
        =
        
          χ
          
            B
          
        
        ψ
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega _{Q}(B)\psi =\chi _{B}\psi ,}
  
i.e. ΩQ is multiplication by the indicator function of B. Therefore, if the system is prepared in state ψ, then the probability of the measured position of the particle being in a Borel set B is

          Ω
          
            Q
          
        
        (
        B
        )
        ψ

          χ

          ∫

where μ is the Lebesgue measure. After the measurement, the wave function collapses to either
