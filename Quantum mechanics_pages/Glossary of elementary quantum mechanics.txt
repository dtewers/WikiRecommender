A basis of the Hilbert space of wave functions with respect to a system.
bra
The Hermitian conjugate of a ket is called a bra. 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        α
        
          |
        
        =
        (
        
          |
        
        α
        ⟩
        
          )
          
            †
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \alpha |=(|\alpha \rangle )^{\dagger }}
  . See "bra–ket notation".
Bra–ket notation
The bra–ket notation is a way to represent the states and operators of a system by angle brackets and vertical bars, for example, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        α
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle }
   and 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        α
        ⟩
        ⟨
        β
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle \langle \beta |}
  .
Density matrix
Physically, the density matrix is a way to represent pure states and mixed states. The density matrix of pure state whose ket is 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        α
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle }
   is 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        α
        ⟩
        ⟨
        α
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\alpha \rangle \langle \alpha |}
  .
Mathematically, a density matrix has to satisfy the following conditions:

  
    
      
        Tr
        ⁡
        (
        ρ
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Tr} (\rho )=1}
  

  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            †
          
        
        =
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho ^{\dagger }=\rho }

A wave function expressed in the form 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        a
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |a\rangle }
   is called a ket. See "bra–ket notation".

    {\displaystyle \langle a|a\rangle =1}
  .
Pure state

Quantum numbers
a way of representing a state by several numbers, which corresponds to a complete set of commuting observables.
A common example of quantum numbers is the possible state of an electron in a central potential: 
  
    
      
        (
        n
        ,
        l
        ,
        m
        ,
        s
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (n,l,m,s)}
  , which corresponds to the eigenstate of observables 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   (in terms of 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
  ), 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   (magnitude of angular momentum), 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            z
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{z}}
   (angular momentum in 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  -direction), and 
  
    
      
        
          S

Spinor

Spatial wave function
Part of a wave function of particle(s). See "total wave function of a particle".
State
A state is a complete description of the observable properties of a physical system.
Sometimes the word is used as a synonym of "wave function" or "pure state".
State vector
synonymous to "wave function".
Statistical ensemble
A large number of copies of a system.
System
A sufficiently isolated part in the universe for investigation.
Tensor product of Hilbert space
When we are considering the total system as a composite system of two subsystems A and B, the wave functions of the composite system are in a Hilbert space 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            A
          
        
        ⊗
        
          H
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{A}\otimes H_{B}}
  , if the Hilbert space of the wave functions for A and B are 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{A}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{B}}
   respectively.
Total wave function of a particle
For single-particle system, the total wave function 
  
    
      
        Ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Psi }
   of a particle can be expressed as a product of spatial wave function and the spinor. The total wave functions are in the tensor product space of the Hilbert space of the spatial part (which is spanned by the position eigenstates) and the Hilbert space for the spin.
Wave function
The word "wave function" could mean one of following:
A vector in Hilbert space which can represent a state; synonymous to "ket" or "state vector".
The state vector in a specific basis. It can be seen as a covariant vector in this case.
The state vector in position representation, e.g. 
  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            α
          
        
        (
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        )
        =
        ⟨
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        
          |
        
        α
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi _{\alpha }(x_{0})=\langle x_{0}|\alpha \rangle }
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          x
          
            0
          
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |x_{0}\rangle }
   is the position eigenstate.

Degeneracy
See "degenerate energy level".
Degenerate energy level
If the energy of different state (wave functions which are not scalar multiple of each other) is the same, the energy level is called degenerate.
There is no degeneracy in 1D system.
Energy spectrum
The energy spectrum refers to the possible energy of a system.
For bound system (bound states), the energy spectrum is discrete; for unbound system (scattering states), the energy spectrum is continuous.

Bound state
A state is called bound state if its position probability density at infinite tends to zero for all the time. Roughly speaking, we can expect to find the particle(s) in a finite size region with certain probability. More precisely, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        (
        
          r
        
        ,
        t
        )
        
          
            |
          
          
            2
          
        
        →
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)|^{2}\to 0}
   when 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          r
        
        
          |
        
        →
        +
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\mathbf {r} |\to +\infty }
  , for all 
  
    
      
        t
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle t>0}
  .
There is a criterion in terms of energy:
Let 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   be the expectation energy of the state. It is a bound state iff 
  
    
      
        E
        <
        min
        ⁡
        {
        V
        (
        r
        →
        −
        ∞
        )
        ,
        V
        (
        r
        →
        +
        ∞
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle E<\operatorname {min} \{V(r\to -\infty ),V(r\to +\infty )\}}
  .

Observable
Mathematically, it is represented by a Hermitian operator.
Quantum Zeno effect
The phenomenon that a frequent measurement leads to "freezing" of the state.


=== Indistinguishable particles ===
Exchange
Intrinsically identical particles
If the intrinsic properties (properties that can be measured but are independent of the quantum state, e.g. charge, total spin, mass) of two particles are the same, they are said to be (intrinsically) identical.
Indistinguishable particles
If a system shows measurable differences when one of its particles is replaced by another particle, these two particles are called distinguishable.
Bosons
Bosons are particles with integer spin (s = 0, 1, 2, ... ). They can either be elementary (like photons) or composite (such as mesons, nuclei or even atoms). There are five known elementary bosons: the four force carrying gauge bosons γ (photon), g (gluon), Z (Z boson) and W (W boson), as well as the Higgs boson.
Fermions
Fermions are particles with half-integer spin (s = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ... ). Like bosons, they can be elementary or composite particles. There are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons, which are the main constituents of ordinary matter.
