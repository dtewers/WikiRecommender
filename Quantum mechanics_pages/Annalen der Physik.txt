Annalen der Physik (English: Annals of Physics) is one of the oldest scientific journals on physics and has been published since 1799. The journal publishes original, peer-reviewed papers in the areas of experimental, theoretical, applied, and mathematical physics and related areas. The current editor-in-chief is Stefan Hildebrandt.
The journal is the successor to Journal der Physik published from 1790 until 1794, and Neues Journal der Physik published from 1795 until 1797. The journal has been published under a variety of names (Annalen der Physik, Annalen der Physik und der physikalischen Chemie, Annalen der Physik und Chemie, Wiedemann's Annalen der Physik und Chemie) during its history.


== History ==
Originally, Annalen der Physik was published in German. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the journal published in both German and English. Initially, only foreign authors contributed articles in English but from the 1970s German-speaking authors increasingly wrote in English in order to reach an international audience. After the German reunification in 1990, English became the only language of the journal.
The importance of Annalen der Physik unquestionably peaked in 1905 with Albert Einstein's Annus Mirabilis papers. In the 1920s, the journal lost ground to the concurrent Zeitschrift für Physik. With the 1933 emigration wave, German-language journals lost many of their best authors. From 1944–1946 publication was interrupted because of World War II, but resumed in 1947 under Soviet occupation rule. While Zeitschrift für Physik moved to Western Germany, Annalen der Physik served physicists in East Germany. After the German reunification, the journal was acquired by Wiley-VCH.
A relaunch of the journal with new editor and new contents was announced for 2012. As a result of the 2012 relaunch, Annalen der Physik now features a refocused scope, an updated editorial board, and new, more modern cover designs.


=== Editors ===
The early editors-in-chief were:
Friedrich Albrecht Carl Gren (1790–1797) (as Journal der Physik and Neues Journal der Physik)
Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert (1799–1824) (as Annalen der Physik and Annalen der Physik und der physikalischen Chemie)
Johann Christian Poggendorff (1824–1876) (as Annalen der Physik und Chemie)
Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann (1877–1899) (as Annalen der Physik und Chemie)
Paul Karl Ludwig Drude (1900–1906) (as Annalen der Physik)
With each editor, the numbering of volumes restarted from 1 (co-existent with a continuous numbering, a perpetual source of confusion). The journal was often referred to by the editor's name: Gilberts Annalen, Poggendorfs Annalen, Wiedemann's Annalen and so on, or for short Pogg. Ann., Wied. Ann.
After Drude, the work was divided between two editors: experimentalists Wilhelm Wien (1907–1928) and Eduard Grüneisen (1929–1949) and theoretician Max Planck (1907–1943, had been associate editor from 1895).
In these times, peer-review was not yet standard. Einstein, for example, just sent his manuscripts to Planck who then subsequently published them.
