In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis, each bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert space has a corresponding adjoint operator. Adjoints of operators generalize conjugate transposes of square matrices to (possibly) infinite-dimensional situations. If one thinks of operators on a complex Hilbert space as "generalized complex numbers", then the adjoint of an operator plays the role of the complex conjugate of a complex number.
In a similar sense there can be defined an adjoint operator for linear (and possibly unbounded) operators between Banach spaces.
The adjoint of an operator A may also be called the Hermitian adjoint, Hermitian conjugate or Hermitian transpose (after Charles Hermite) of A and is denoted by A∗ or A† (the latter especially when used in conjunction with the bra–ket notation).


== Informal definition ==
Consider a linear operator 
  
    
      
        A
        :
        
          H
          
            1
          
        
        →
        
          H
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A:H_{1}\to H_{2}}
   between Hilbert spaces. Without taking care of any details, the adjoint operator is the (in most cases uniquely defined) linear operator 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        :
        
          H
          
            2
          
        
        →
        
          H
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A^{*}:H_{2}\to H_{1}}
   fulfilling

  
    
      
        ⟨
        A
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        
          ⟩
          
            
              H
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        =
        ⟨
        
          h
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        
          h
          
            2
          
        
        
          ⟩

                1
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Ah_{1},h_{2}\rangle _{H_{2}}=\langle h_{1},A^{*}h_{2}\rangle _{H_{1}},}
  
where 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        
          ⟩
          
            
              H
              
                i
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle _{H_{i}}}
   is the inner product in the Hilbert space 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{i}}
  . Note the special case where both Hilbert spaces are identical and 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is an operator on some Hilbert space.
When one trades the dual pairing for the inner product, one can define the adjoint of an operator 
  
    
      
        A
        :
        E
        →
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle A:E\to F}
  , where 
  
    
      
        E
        ,
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle E,F}
   are Banach spaces with corresponding norms 
  
    
      
        ∥
        ⋅
        
          ∥
          
            E
          
        
        ,
        ∥
        ⋅
        
          ∥
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|_{E},\|\cdot \|_{F}}
  . Here (again not considering any technicalities), its adjoint operator is defined as 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        :
        
          F
          
            ∗
          
        
        →
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A^{*}:F^{*}\to E^{*}}
   with

  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        f
        =
        (
        u
        ↦
        f
        (
        A
        u
        )
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle A^{*}f=(u\mapsto f(Au)),}
  
i.e. 
  
    
      
        (
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        f
        )
        (
        u
        )
        =
        f
        (
        A
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A^{*}f)(u)=f(Au)}
   for 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        
          F
          
            ∗
          
        
        ,
        u
        ∈
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in F^{*},u\in E}
  .
Note that the above definition in the Hilbert space setting is really just an application of the Banach space case when one identifies a Hilbert space with its dual. Then it is only natural that we can also obtain the adjoint of an operator 
  
    
      
        A
        :
        H
        →
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle A:H\to E}
  , where 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   is a Hilbert space and 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is a Banach space. The dual is then defined as 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        :
        
          E
          
            ∗
          
        
        →
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle A^{*}:E^{*}\to H}
   with 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        f
        =
        
          h
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A^{*}f=h_{f}}
   such that

  
    
      
        ⟨
        
          h
          
            f
          
        
        ,
        h

        =
        f
        (
        A
        u
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle h_{f},h\rangle _{H}=f(Au).}

   instead of 
  
    
      
        D
        (

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle D(A^{*})\to (D(A))^{*}.}
   Remark also that this does not mean that 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   can be extended on all of 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   but the extension only worked for specific elements 
  
    
      
        g
        ∈
        D
        (
        
          A

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g\in D(A^{*})}
  .
Now we can define the adjoint of

== Definition for bounded operators between Hilbert spaces ==
Suppose H is a complex Hilbert space, with inner product 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ⋅
        ,
        ⋅
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }
  . Consider a continuous linear operator A : H → H (for linear operators, continuity is equivalent to being a bounded operator). Then the adjoint of A is the continuous linear operator A∗ : H → H satisfying

  
    
      
        ⟨
        A
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        y
        ⟩
        
        
          for all 
        
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        H
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Ax,y\rangle =\langle x,A^{*}y\rangle \quad {\mbox{for all }}x,y\in H.}
  
Existence and uniqueness of this operator follows from the Riesz representation theorem.
This can be seen as a generalization of the adjoint matrix of a square matrix which has a similar property involving the standard complex inner product.


== Properties ==
The following properties of the Hermitian adjoint of bounded operators are immediate:
A∗∗ = A – involutiveness
If A is invertible, then so is A∗, with (A∗)−1 = (A−1)∗
(A + B)∗ = A∗ + B∗
(λA)∗ = λA∗, where λ denotes the complex conjugate of the complex number λ – antilinearity (together with 3.)
(AB)∗ = B∗A∗
If we define the operator norm of A by

  
    
      
        ∥
        A
        
          ∥
          
            o
            p
          
        
        :=
        sup
        {
        ∥
        A
        x
        ∥
        :
        ∥
        x
        ∥
        ≤
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|A\|_{op}:=\sup\{\|Ax\|:\|x\|\leq 1\}}
  
then

  
    
      
        ∥
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        
          ∥
          
            o
            p
          
        
        =
        ∥
        A
        
          ∥
          
            o
            p
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|A^{*}\|_{op}=\|A\|_{op}.}
  
Moreover,

  
    
      
        ∥
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        A
        
          ∥
          
            o
            p
          
        
        =
        ∥
        A
        
          ∥
          
            o
            p
          
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \|A^{*}A\|_{op}=\|A\|_{op}^{2}.}
  
One says that a norm that satisfies this condition behaves like a "largest value", extrapolating from the case of self-adjoint operators.
The set of bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space H together with the adjoint operation and the operator norm form the prototype of a C*-algebra.


== Adjoint of densely defined unbounded operators between Hilbert spaces ==
A densely defined operator A from a complex Hilbert space H to itself is a linear operator whose domain D(A) is a dense linear subspace of H and whose values lies in H. By definition, the domain D(A∗) of its adjoint A∗ is the set of all y ∈ H for which there is a z ∈ H satisfying

  
    
      
        ⟨
        A
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        z
        ⟩
        
        
          for all 
        
        x
        ∈
        D
        (
        A
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Ax,y\rangle =\langle x,z\rangle \quad {\mbox{for all }}x\in D(A),}
  
and A∗(y) is defined to be the z thus found.
Properties 1.–5. hold with appropriate clauses about domains and codomains. For instance, the last property now states that (AB)∗ is an extension of B∗A∗ if A, B and AB are densely defined operators.
The relationship between the image of A and the kernel of its adjoint is given by:

  
    
      
        ker
        ⁡
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            im
            ⁡
             
            A
            )
          
          
            ⊥
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ker A^{*}=\left(\operatorname {im} \ A\right)^{\bot }}
  

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            ker
            ⁡
            
              A
              
                ∗
              
            
            )
          
          
            ⊥
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              im
              ⁡
               
              A
            
            ¯
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\ker A^{*}\right)^{\bot }={\overline {\operatorname {im} \ A}}}
  
These statements are equivalent. See orthogonal complement for the proof of this and for the definition of 
  
    
      
        ⊥
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bot }

                ,
                y
                ⟩
                =
                0
                
                ∀
                y
                ∈

                ⟨
                x
                ,
                A

                H
              
            
            
              
              
                
                
                ⟺
                
                x
                 
                ⊥
                 
                im
                ⁡
                 
                A

The second equation follows from the first by taking the orthogonal complement on both sides. Note that in general, the image need not be closed, but the kernel of a continuous operator always is.


== Hermitian operators ==
A bounded operator A : H → H is called Hermitian or self-adjoint if

  
    
      
        A
        =
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=A^{*}}
  
which is equivalent to

  
    
      
        ⟨
        A
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        A
        y
        ⟩
        
           for all 
        
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        H
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Ax,y\rangle =\langle x,Ay\rangle {\mbox{ for all }}x,y\in H.}
  
In some sense, these operators play the role of the real numbers (being equal to their own "complex conjugate") and form a real vector space. They serve as the model of real-valued observables in quantum mechanics. See the article on self-adjoint operators for a full treatment.


== Adjoints of antilinear operators ==
For an antilinear operator the definition of adjoint needs to be adjusted in order to compensate for the complex conjugation. An adjoint operator of the antilinear operator A on a complex Hilbert space H is an antilinear operator A∗ : H → H with the property:

  
    
      
        ⟨
        A
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        
          
            
              ⟨
              x
              ,
              
                A
                
                  ∗
                
              
              y
              ⟩
            
            ¯
          
        
        
        
          for all 
        
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        H
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Ax,y\rangle ={\overline {\langle x,A^{*}y\rangle }}\quad {\text{for all }}x,y\in H.}
  


== Other adjoints ==
The equation

  
    
      
        ⟨
        A
        x
        ,
        y
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨
        x
        ,
        
          A
          
            ∗
          
        
        y
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Ax,y\rangle =\langle x,A^{*}y\rangle }
  
is formally similar to the defining properties of pairs of adjoint functors in category theory, and this is where adjoint functors got their name from.
