Universe Today (UT) is a moderately popular North American based non-commercial space and astronomy news site. Although the domain was registered on December 31, 1998, it was founded in March 1999, the current form of the Universe Today website began on 24 July 2003, to mainly discuss astronomy news and space-related issues.
By early September 2005, the forum section merged with Bad Astronomy as a combined site with the BAUT forum. During April 2011, the Association of British Science Writers noted that Universe Today decided not to make preparations for reporting on embargoed stories until they are public knowledge.
Emily Lakdawalla said that she relies on Universe Today and Bad Astronomy to "give ... an independent look at big news stories".
