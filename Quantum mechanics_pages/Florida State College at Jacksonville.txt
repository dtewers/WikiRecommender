Florida State College at Jacksonville (FSCJ) is a state college in Jacksonville, Florida, U.S., and part of the Florida College System. It is one of several institutions in the Florida College System designated a "state college," as it offers a greater number of four-year bachelor's degrees than traditional two-year community colleges.
The College was established in 1965. It has four major physical campuses and several additional centers located around the First Coast region, and currently enrolls 52,000 students.


== History ==
The institution was founded in 1965 as Florida Junior College. With the growth of the community college movement, it was renamed Florida Community College at Jacksonville (FCCJ) in 1986.
In 2009, in recognition of a shortage of four-year colleges in the state, the Florida Legislature passed legislation creating the Florida College System, enabling some community colleges to become "state colleges", meaning they can offer more bachelor's degrees than traditional community colleges, but no graduate degree programs. FCCJ was one of the first community colleges to make the change, and, also in 2009, announced the change to their current name, "Florida State College at Jacksonville".
