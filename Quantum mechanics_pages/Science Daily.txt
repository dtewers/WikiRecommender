Science Daily is an American news website for topical science articles. It features articles on a wide variety of science topics including: astronomy, exoplanets, computer science, nanotechnology, medicine, linguistics, psychology, sociology, anthropology, biology, geology, climate, space, physics, mathematics, chemistry, archeology, paleontology, and others.
The website was founded in 1995 by science writer Dan Hogan. The articles are selected from news releases submitted by universities and other research institutions. Some articles are written by Science Daily staff. The site is updated once daily, although more new articles are added during a given weekday than on the weekend. Users can subscribe to a free daily newsletter distributed by email, which contains links to all articles for the day and a short introduction to each article.
In 2011, Quantcast listed it as a top 653 site with 2,000,000+ U.S. people visiting per month and this being 60% of all visitors.
