In quantum mechanics, the rectangular (or, at times, square) potential barrier is a standard one-dimensional problem that demonstrates the phenomena of wave-mechanical tunneling (also called "quantum tunneling") and wave-mechanical reflection. The problem consists of solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle encountering a rectangular potential energy barrier. It is usually assumed, as here, that a free particle impinges on the barrier from the left.
Although a particle hypothetically behaving as a point mass would be reflected, a particle actually behaving as a matter wave has a finite probability that it will penetrate the barrier and continue its travel as a wave on the other side. In classical wave-physics, this effect is known as evanescent wave coupling. The likelihood that the particle will pass through the barrier is given by the transmission coefficient, whereas the likelihood that it is reflected is given by the reflection coefficient. Schrödinger's wave-equation allows these coefficients to be calculated.

== Transmission and reflection ==
At this point, it is instructive to compare the situation to the classical case. In both cases, the particle behaves as a free particle outside of the barrier region. A classical particle with energy 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   larger than the barrier height 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{0}}
   would always pass the barrier, and a classical particle with 
  
    
      
        E
        <
        
          V
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E<V_{0}}
   incident on the barrier would always get reflected.
To study the quantum case, consider the following situation: a particle incident on the barrier from the left side (
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{r}}
  ). It may be reflected (
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            l
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{l}}
  ) or transmitted (
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{r}}
  ).
To find the amplitudes for reflection and transmission for incidence from the left, we put in the above equations 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            r
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{r}=1}
   (incoming particle), 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            l
          
        
        =
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{l}=r}
   (reflection), 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            l
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{l}}
  =0 (no incoming particle from the right), and 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            r
          
        
        =
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{r}=t}
   (transmission). We then eliminate the coefficients

            l

The transmission is exponentially suppressed with the barrier width, which can be understood from the functional form of the wave function: Outside of the barrier it oscillates with wave vector

    {\displaystyle 1/k_{1}}
  . If the barrier is much larger than this decay length, the left and right part are virtually independent and tunneling as a consequence is suppressed.

== Remarks and applications ==
The calculation presented above may at first seem unrealistic and hardly useful. However it has proved to be a suitable model for a variety of real-life systems. One such example are interfaces between two conducting materials. In the bulk of the materials, the motion of the electrons is quasi-free and can be described by the kinetic term in the above Hamiltonian with an effective mass 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  . Often the surfaces of such materials are covered with oxide layers or are not ideal for other reasons. This thin, non-conducting layer may then be modeled by a barrier potential as above. Electrons may then tunnel from one material to the other giving rise to a current.
The operation of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) relies on this tunneling effect. In that case, the barrier is due to the gap between the tip of the STM and the underlying object. Since the tunnel current depends exponentially on the barrier width, this device is extremely sensitive to height variations on the examined sample.
The above model is one-dimensional, while space is three-dimensional. One should solve the Schrödinger equation in three dimensions. On the other hand, many systems only change along one coordinate direction and are translationally invariant along the others; they are separable. The Schrödinger equation may then be reduced to the case considered here by an ansatz for the wave function of the type: 
  
    
      
        Ψ
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
        =
        ψ
        (
        x
        )
        ϕ
        (
        y
        ,
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Psi (x,y,z)=\psi (x)\phi (y,z)}
  .
For another, related model of a barrier, see Delta potential barrier (QM), which can be regarded as a special case of the finite potential barrier. All results from this article immediately apply to the delta potential barrier's taking the limits
