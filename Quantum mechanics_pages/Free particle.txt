In physics, a free particle is a particle that, in some sense, is not bound by an external force, or equivalently not in a region where its potential energy varies. In classical physics, this means the particle is present in a "field-free" space. In quantum mechanics, it means a region of uniform potential, usually set to zero in the region of interest since potential can be arbitrarily set to zero at any point (or surface in three dimensions) in space.


== Classical free particle ==
The classical free particle is characterized simply by a fixed velocity v. The momentum is given by

  
    
      
        
          p
        
        =
        m
        
          v
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} }
  
and the kinetic energy (equal to total energy) by

  
    
      
        E
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        m
        
          v
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}
  
where m is the mass of the particle and v is the vector velocity of the particle.

A free quantum particle is described by the Schrödinger equation:

  
    
      
        −

where ψ is the wavefunction of the particle at position r and time t. The solution for a particle with momentum p or wave vector k, at angular frequency ω or energy E, is given by the complex plane wave:

This is the normalization condition for the wave function. The wavefunction is not normalizable for a plane wave, but is for a wavepacket.

In this case, the free particle wavefunction may be represented by a superposition of free particle momentum eigenfunctions ϕ(k), the Fourier transform of the momentum space wavefunction:

The expectation value of the energy E is (for both plane wave and general wave packet; here one can observe the special status of time and hence energy in quantum mechanics as opposed to space and momentum)

For the plane wave, solving for k and ω and substituting into the constraint equation yields the familiar relationship between energy and momentum for non-relativistic massive particles

  
    
      
        ⟨
        E
        ⟩
        =

                p
              
              
                ⟩

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle E\rangle ={\frac {\langle \mathbf {p} \rangle ^{2}}{2m}}.}
  
In general, the identity holds in the form

  
    
      
        ⟨
        E
        ⟩
        =

    {\displaystyle \langle E\rangle ={\frac {\langle p^{2}\rangle }{2m}}}
  
where p = |p| is the magnitude of the momentum vector.
The group velocity of the plane wave is defined as

  
    
      
        
          v
          
            g
          
        
        =

    {\displaystyle v_{g}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}}}
  
which turns out to be the classical velocity of the particle. The phase velocity of the plane wave is defined as
