The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) is a non-profit organization of industry professionals and presents a series of annual Interactive Achievement Awards.


== History ==
AIAS was founded in 1992 by Andrew Zucker. After building an organization of close to 400 members consisting of executives from both the gaming and entertainment industries, as well as a board of 40 notable industry leaders including visionary Timothy Leary, AIAS produced the first televised awards show honoring computer games in 1994, which was broadcast live from Universal Studios Hollywood via TBS. The show, entitled "Cybermania '94" was hosted by Leslie Nielsen and Jonathan Taylor Thomas. In 1995, the second annual awards show became the first awards program streamed on the Web, via bravo.com, at the same time promoted by its sister television network, Bravo. As originally envisioned by Andrew Zucker, AIAS was to become a bridge between Silicon Valley and Hollywood, thus serving to link and provide a forum for dialogue between professionals in both technology and entertainment. Judging was independently audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. AIAS co-promoted numerous events with organizations such as the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the Directors Guild of America and Women in Film.
Thereafter, in 1996, AIAS was re-established is a non-profit organization that promotes computer and video game entertainment with the annual D.I.C.E. Summit event, where its Interactive Achievement Awards ceremony has been held annually since 1998. Its membership consists of industry professionals, and only professional members who meet a set of minimum criteria are able to vote for the best entertainment software of the year.
On October 24, 2012, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences announced that the IAAs would be known as the D.I.C.E. Awards beginning in 2013. The name stands for "Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain".


== D.I.C.E. Awards ==
The D.I.C.E. Awards (formerly the Interactive Achievement Awards (IAAs)) are the awards that recognize the year's best videogames, computer games, online entertainment, outstanding individuals, and groundbreaking development teams that have propelled the advancement of the entertainment software industry.
