The Golden Joystick Awards, also known as the People's Gaming Awards, is a video game award ceremony; it awards the best video games of the year, as voted for by the British general public. As of 2016, the ceremony was in its 34th year. It is the second-oldest video game award ceremony after the Arcade Awards.
The awards were initially focused on computer games, but were later extended to include console games as well, owing to the success of video game consoles such as the Sega Master System and the Sega Mega Drive in the United Kingdom. The ceremony is not related to the prize given away to successful contestants on GamesMaster, a British television show.
As of 2014, it is the biggest video game award show in terms of the number of votes cast; over nine million votes were cast for the 2014 ceremony.
