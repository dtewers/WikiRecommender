A game artist is an artist who creates art for one or more types of games. In video games, game artists are responsible for all of the aspects of game development that call for visual art. Game artists play a vital role and are often credited in role-playing games, collectible card games and video games.


== Role-playing games ==
Many game artists are called upon to develop graphical treatments for the environments and elements in which role-playing games take place. For example, in the Monster Manual early Dungeons & Dragons artists created visual representations of monsters players might encounter while adventuring. Many such depictions may influence subsequent art and the type of campaigns or adventures that developers and players create.
Art for role-playing games can be expressed in a variety of media, from pencil drawings, to pen and ink illustrations, to oil paintings or even 3D models created with a computer. Therefore, no one skill set can be pinpointed as necessary for a role-playing game artist, beyond that of some artistic ability. Necessary skills will vary from game to game and developer to developer.


== Video games ==

In modern video games, game artists create 2D art, such as, concept art, sprites, textures and environment backdrops; and 3D art, such as, models, animations and level layout. Video game artists can earn an annual salary anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 depending on experience and region.
