The British Academy Games Awards are an annual British awards ceremony honoring "outstanding creative achievement" in the video game industry. First presented in 2004 following the restructuring of the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, the awards are presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), and are thus commonly referred to as the BAFTA Games Awards.
Since the inaugural BAFTA Games Awards in 2004, eleven ceremonies have taken place. The most recent, the 13th British Academy Games Awards, was held on 6 April 2017 at Tobacco Dock in London.
