The Telegraph Media Group (TMG, previously the Telegraph Group) is the proprietor of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph. It is a subsidiary of Press Holdings. David and Frederick Barclay acquired the group in July 2004, after months of intense bidding and lawsuits, from Hollinger Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the newspaper group controlled by the Canadian-born British businessman Conrad Black.
In 2015, TMG made an operating profit of £51 million. Profits before tax were £47m, and turnover for the 53 weeks up to 3 January 2016 was £319m, according to unaudited accounts leaked to The Guardian. If these figures are accurate, then this was an increase from 2014 levels on both accounts.
