Courtenay Taylor is an American actress best known for voice work in major franchise video games and animated series, including Titanfall 2, Halo, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, Regular Show, Fallout 4 and For Honor.


== Career ==
Taylor's first videogame project was Star Trek: Starfleet Command III. Since then, Taylor has provided the voices for such characters as Juhani in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jack in the Mass Effect franchise, and the female player character in Fallout 4. Her voice acting agency is SBV Talent. In addition to her work as a voice actress, Taylor has acted in and produced a number of on-camera projects.
When asked how she created the voice of Starla from Regular Show, Taylor explained: "I read for Starla and another smaller character. I wanted to do an annoying, Harvey Fierstein kind of voice. Nobody would want to hear this voice for any length of time. I made the cashier sound like that.” As it turns out, her voice for the cashier was exactly what the crew wanted, not the original one she had performed for Starla. At first Taylor did not understand, but after hearing how Muscle Man sounded, the show’s entire aural aesthetic clicked for her.
