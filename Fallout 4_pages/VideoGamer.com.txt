VideoGamer.com (formerly known as Pro-G) is a London-based website focused on video game news, reviews, previews and videos. It is part of the Candy Banana network of websites, operated by Swedish parent IBIBI HB.


== History ==
The site was initially launched in November 2004 as Pro-G.co.uk by university friends Adam McCann and Tom Orry. In 2007, with the growing popularity of the site, McCann and Orry formed Pro-G Media Ltd., and the domain name of the site was changed to VideoGamer.com. On changing the site name, Orry said "You'll just be seeing it [the site's content] all on a fancy new website with a name that we feel is a little more obvious".
On 6 October 2008, VideoGamer.com launched a high-definition video service, capable of streaming 720p HD videos, which is claimed to be the first amongst UK games websites.
Matt Lees and Steve Burns were hired in late 2012 replacing Neon Kelly and Martin Gaston respectively. Jim Trinca joined the site as video producer in 2014.
In March 2015, Pro-G Media Ltd. was acquired by Swedish Company IBIBI HB. As part of this acquisition, IBIBI HB formed a new company and network entitled 'Candy Banana', consisting of VideoGamer and other properties acquired by IBIBI HB. Thomas Isaksson, a representative of IBIBI HB, said "We’re delighted to join forces with Adam, Tom, James [Orry] and the team. With great sites, content, and community, I believe we have a formidable network that’s only going to get better and better."
During the mid 2010s VideoGamer focused on humorous content to gain an audience in the videogamer coverage space, including Jim Trinca's character "Yir Auld Da", a fictional elderly scotsman. In 2016 Trinca and Steven Burns left the company, forming their own production. A redesigned website was launched in late 2016.
On December 20, 2016 co-founders Tom Orry and James Orry and Deputy Editor David Scammell all left VideoGamer. The following day Samuel James Riley announced via Twitter that he was leaving VideoGamer also.
In March 2017, it was announced that Resero Network picked up VideoGamer from Candy Banana.
