Eurogamer is a website and YouTube channel focused on video game news, reviews and other features. It is operated by Gamer Network Ltd. with headquarters in Brighton, East Sussex, which was formed in 1999 by brothers Rupert and Nick Loman while they were still in high school.
Gamer Network states that the site has the largest readership of any independent videogames website in Europe (over 5.7 million unique users in November 2011), and was the first such site to subject its traffic to independent verification by the ABC Electronic system. The site primarily caters to a UK/Ireland audience; Gamer Network operates other sites using the Eurogamer brand that caters to other European countries.
Most of its reviews are of European or PAL releases of the games, unless the time disparity between Japanese or North American/NTSC releases is such that reviews are written using the latter. In February 2015, Eurogamer dropped its 10-point scale review scores system in favour of a "recommendation system", where games would either receive no specific recommendation or awards for being "Recommended", "Essential" or worthy of an "Avoid".

Eurogamer's current editor is Oli Welsh, who took over the role from Tom Bramwell in September 2014. The editor prior to Bramwell was Kristan Reed.

Eurogamer founder Rupert Loman was interviewed in February 2007 by MCV magazine. He was also featured in the Sunday Telegraph on 19 August 2007, speaking about the experience he has gained from choosing to run Eurogamer instead of attending university.
